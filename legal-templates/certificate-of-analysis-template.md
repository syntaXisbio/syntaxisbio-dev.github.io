## STORAGE AND HANDLING RECOMMENDATIONS

**Receiving Cells:**
1. Upon receipt, immediately transfer vials to liquid nitrogen or ≤-150°C freezer
2. Cells are shipped on dry ice; some dry ice sublimation during shipping is normal
3. If vials arrive partially thawed or warm, contact SyntaxisBio immediately at [phone/email]

**Thawing Cells:**
1. Rapidly thaw vial in 37°C water bath (1-2 minutes)
2. Immediately dilute cells into pre-warmed complete medium (10-20 mL)
3. Centrifuge gently and resuspend in fresh medium
4. Plate cells and allow 24-48 hours for recovery before passaging

**Passaging and Maintenance:**
1. Maintain cells according to recommended culture conditions
2. Track passage number carefully; cell characteristics may change at high passages
3. For PUF-authenticated lines: Use provided tracking protocols to monitor age
4. Regularly test for mycoplasma contamination (recommended every 2-3 months)

**Long-Term Storage:**
1. Establish a working cell bank at low passage number (P+2 to P+5)
2. Store backup vials in liquid nitrogen
3. Do not repeatedly freeze-thaw cells

**Warranty:** SyntaxisBio warrants that this cell line conforms to the specifications described in this Certificate of Analysis at the time of shipment. All test results reflect the condition of the material at the time of analysis.

**Post-Shipment:** SyntaxisBio cannot guarantee cell viability or performance after shipment due to variables in shipping, handling, thawing, and culture conditions. Claims regarding viability or sterility must be reported within 30 days of receipt with supporting documentation.

**Biosafety:** This cell line should be handled at Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) or higher as recommended for all human-derived cell lines. Follow all institutional biosafety protocols.

**Genetic Stability:** While cells are validated at cryopreservation, genetic drift may occur with extensive passaging. SyntaxisBio recommends using cells at passage numbers as close to the provided material as possible and establishing a working cell bank for long-term projects.
